A clock contract for advancing a state machine. See src/msg.rs for API
documentation.

To receive ticks from this contract, import
`covenant_clock_derive::clocked` and derive `#[clocked]` on your
contract's execute message. See this contract's execute message for an
example.

To advance the clock, call `ExecuteMsg::Tick {}` on this
contract. Anyone may call this method.
